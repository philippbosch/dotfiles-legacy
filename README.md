dotfiles
========

This is a set of basic files I keep in my home dir on all the servers 
I work with. The technique for managing them is the one described by
Ryan Tomayko [here](https://github.com/rtomayko/dotfiles#readme).

Usage
-----

    $ cd $HOME
    $ git clone git@github.com:philippbosch/dotfiles.git .

Then install [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh):

    $ curl -L https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh | sh
